        <h2 id="first-post">what is the best glove for a Baseball player!</h2>
        <h6>Wilson A 2000 glove starting at around $280. Mlb players love this glove and will last a while.</h6>
        
        <p> Wilson is the world's leading manufacturer of baseball and softball equipment, and the most iconic brand in these sports
            .Headquartered in Thousand Oaks, CA, Wilson Diamond Sports, LLC. manufactures bats, ball gloves, apparel, bags, batting gloves, helmets, catcher's equipment and related accessories.
                The company's commitment to innovation and game-changing technologies propelled Easton to the No. 1 bat position, including breakthrough technologies with aluminum and composite materials. As a result of this commitment to R&D and its storied brand heritage, Easton has long-standing relationships with Little League Baseball, USSSA Baseball & Softball, USA Baseball & Softball, hundreds of NCAA collegiate teams and numerous professional baseball and softball players.</p>
       <h2 id="second-post">Can it be worse?</h2>
        <h6>A champro glove is the worst glove in my opinion. </h6>
        
        <p>The champro glove may have been the easiest choice for this worst gloves ever list. As if the name champro wasn’t enough evidence the glove was a sham, you can still find these gloves for sale all over the place, new in wrapper. Maybe the word champro means something akin to awesome in Canada (where Combat was produced before going defunct)?
The Grifter served as a replacement glove for many full composite bats—including the very famous Combat DaBomb B2—that were banned in 2013 for Little League play. That glove exchange was more egregious than the Hornets trading Vlade Divac for Kobe Bryant. It was exchanging power for a hand-ringing black hole of a glove that did nothing but break.
We made the awesome mistake of purchasing this bat as one of our very first forays into the youth performance glove space. Depending on the diameter, the glove used anywhere from a drop 9 to drop 11. In reality, the glove often weighed more like a drop 6. Ours broke on the handle. Twice. It stands as the worst glove ever among both players and distributors.
