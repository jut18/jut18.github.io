       <h2 id="second-post">Can it be worse?</h2>
        <h6>A SKLZ Lightning Bolt Pro Pitching Machine is the worst machine in my opinion. </h6>
        
<!--         <p>TheSKLZ Lightning Bolt Pro Pitching Machine may have been the easiest choice for this worst machine ever list. As if the name SKLZ Lightning Bolt Pro Pitching Machine wasn’t enough evidence the SKLZ Lightning Bolt Pro Pitching MachineSKLZ Lightning Bolt Pro Pitching MachineSKLZ Lightning Bolt Pro Pitching Machine was a sham, you can still find these machine for sale all over the place, new in wrapper. Maybe the word SKLZ Lightning Bolt Pro Pitching Machine means something akin to awesome in Canada?
The SKLZ Lightning Bolt Pro Pitching Machine served as a replacement machine —including the very famous Combat DaBomb B2—that were banned in 2013 for Little League play. That machine exchange was more egregious than the Hornets trading Vlade Divac for Kobe Bryant. It was exchanging power for a hand-ringing black hole of a machine that did nothing but break.
We made the awesome mistake of purchasing this bat as one of our very first forays into the youth performance machine space. Depending on the diameter, the machine used anywhere from a drop 9 to drop 11. In reality, the glove often weighed more like a drop 6. Ours broke on the handle. Twice. It stands as the worst machine ever among both players and distributors.
